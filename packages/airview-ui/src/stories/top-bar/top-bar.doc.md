The TopBar component is used to display a persistent area to display content and actions related to the current view. The color can be customised, by passing a valid Material UI theme palette or customising the primary theme color via the `airviewUiThemeProvider` config.

## TopBar States

The TopBar can be rendered in two states, namely:

- **NavClosed ** The toggle navigation button is rendered in a closed state
- **NavOpen ** The toggle navigation button is rendered in an open state

## Importing the component

You can import the Menu component as a named import from the airview-ui library

```javascript
import { TopBar } from "airview-ui";
```
