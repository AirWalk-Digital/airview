## NavigationDrawer States

The NavigationDrawer can be rendered in two states, namely:

- **Closed ** The NavigationDrawer is hidden from the user
- **Open ** The NavigationDrawer is visible to the user

## Importing the component

You can import the NavigationDrawer component as a named import from the airview-ui library

```javascript
import { NavigationDrawer } from "airview-ui";
```
